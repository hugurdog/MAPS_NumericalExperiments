# MAPS_NumericalExperiments
This repository contains the Numerical Experiments performed to justify the use of the so called MAPS estimators to direct the eigen vector shrinkage of the covariance matrices. This experiments are reported in my Ph.d. thesis at Florida State University, Mathematics Department.
