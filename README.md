# MAPS_NumericalExperiments
This repository contains the Numerical Experiments performed to justify the use of the so called MAPS estimators to direct the eigen vector shrinkage of the covariance matrices. This experiments are reported in my Ph.d. thesis at Florida State University, Mathematics Department. 

The following is the current ingredients and their description of the repository, 

(1) MAPSWithSimulatedBetas.py:
This performs the experiments that are reported in the section 3.1 of the dissertation titled: "EIGENVECTOR SHRINKAGE FOR ESTIMATING COVARIANCE MATRICES"

(2) SingleBlock.py: 
This performs the experiments that are reported in the sub-section 3.2.1 of the dissertation titled: "EIGENVECTOR SHRINKAGE FOR ESTIMATING COVARIANCE MATRICES"

(3) DynamicalMAPSWithHistoricalBetas.py:
This performs the experiments that are reported in the sub-section 3.2.2 of the dissertation titled: "EIGENVECTOR SHRINKAGE FOR ESTIMATING COVARIANCE MATRICES"

(4) WRDSBETASNEW.csv: 
This document contains the historical betas that is obtained via the WRDS beta's module. This document is referred by the items (2) and (3) above.
